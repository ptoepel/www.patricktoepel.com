    In my career and personal life, I have found technology, in all its various
    forms, lovely. It has improved my life, and my friends' lives around me, and
    doesn't appear to be vanishing anytime soon. If you like these types of
    journies, then follow me. This is where I store my projects and various
    adventures.
description: Here are several brands that I have worked with over the years. One
  from a paying client and the other from a friend who tried to start up a
  business at the start of the pandemic. Both I pride myself on, they were
  wonderfully challenge requests.

        Moufpiece Entertainment was a side project for a friend of mine. He
        created a podcast business and needed a website that would showcase his
        gallery of media types. It was themed and customized to match the brand
        and it's administrative needs.

        Another friend of mine needed a business website for her hair care and
        skin products. She needed something quick and something that she and her
        husband could manage. This was a fun project that required me to dig
        deep into the WooCommerce side of WordPress.

        A national dance event that I started that went from sixty locals to
        about five hundrend total attendees. It was a expeirence that was once
        in a life-time but it also gave me the coding chops to get my web
        development career up and going.
